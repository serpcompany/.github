## Our Tools

- Github / Volta
- Loom
- Slack
- Google Drive


### Github

Stay up to date on your @tags, todos, etc. using the [Github Notifications Inbox](https://github.com/notifications), or [Volta](https://volta.net/) (which most our team uses).

Grab issues from the "todo" column in Volta, and mark them as "In Progress" when you're ready to begin. 

Make sure to follow our team's collaborative [git workflow](./docs/git-workflow.md) & [git commit conventions](./docs/git-commit-conventions.md).

#### Volta

[Volta](https://volta.net/) is a free tool that aims to improve the "proejct management" UX and features of Github.

### Loom

Loom is the preferred method of communication long-form communication. Explaining things in Slack (like most people do) especially things that require conversations or back-and-forth typing - that will eventually just get lost anyways AND requires people to be online at the same time.

Instead, record a loom video and "share" it into the SERP workspace so everyone can search it and watch or re-watch it whenever they need to.

**We use loom to: **
- Minimize meetings
- Save time typing
- A storage / searchable repository for information to reference later when needed.

Plus, Loom AI will auto generate a Title, Transcript, Summary & Clickable Chapters - which are all also searchable.

**Loom team account:**

We have a team loom account you can use so you don't have to pay.

- If you'd like to be added for "view/search only access" - let our team know so we can add you to our shared email forwarder `loom@serp.co`.
- If you need to be added for "creator access" - let our team know to add your personal email account as a 'creator lite'. If you reach your max videos then we can upgrade it later.


### Slack

Slack is mainly for conversations or quick comms.

What we DON'T use Slack for:
- Explaining how things work (that should go in a Loom video)
- Sharing any information that might be forgotten, might be needed to reference later, etc.
- Assigning tasks. If anything is "assigned" as a todo in Slack it MUST be added to our project management area (Github projects / issues) for it to be "real".


### Google Drive

We use Google Drive to store things that are too big for Github.
Google Drive is NOT a "source of truth" for us - it is only for things that are too big to be stored/shared in Github.

**Google Drive Rules:**

1. Make sure to always share links that are properly permissions so that person doesn't have to "request access" (that wastes time and makes everything less 'asynchronous').
2. Always leave links in the relevant github issues/project cards to the Google Drive resource - as Drive "search" is terrible and nothing will ever be found if its not linked to from Github.
