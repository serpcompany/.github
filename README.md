# Our Story

10 years ago, we started SERP as a simple SEO agency.

Our scope was smaller, but our drive was the same as it is today: helping underdogs win against the giants. 

We've always fought for the little guy and found ways to help them pull off the digital version of David v Goliath.

Then the playing field tilted even further.

AI advanced at breakneck speed, creating an unprecedented advantage for tech giants with deep pockets. These companies leveraged collective data from billions of users to train powerful AI systems, then locked those capabilities behind expensive paywalls.

The gap between digital haves and have-nots widened into a chasm. The same technologies that promised to democratize opportunity instead concentrated power in fewer hands.

The window to change this trajectory is closing rapidly. We may not get another chance.

Digital power must return to its rightful owners before it's too late.

## For Brands

We build growth & automation solutions that help brands succeed online. No false promises, no vanity metrics â€“ just systems that deliver real results. Our services have generated over $100M for businesses across 200+ industries. We'd love to help you grow too.

## For Individuals

We believe AI and digital tools shouldn't be locked behind corporate paywalls. This technology was built using everyone's online contributions, and now we're being charged for the fruits of that labor. So we've set out to create as many free tools and resources for the individual as we can.

## Join the Alliance

We see ourselves as part of the Alliance standing up to a growing Empire. While corporations consolidate power, we're working to put that power back in your hands.

But we're a small team and we can't do it alone. 

We need your help.

So, if you see yourself as someone who likes to fight for the individual, instead of the large corporations, we want your help.

The digital world shouldn't just work for the privileged few.

Let's build it differently together, before we lose our shot.

Join the SERP Alliance and help secure the future of the internet for the individual.
