# DEFINITION OF DONE

The "definition of done" (DoD) is the set of criteria that a `user story`, `feature` (aka "project backlog item") or `issue` must meet to be considered complete.

It is as a quality assurance tool helps ensure any & all work done by the team is high-quality, reliable, and deployable with every check into version control.

## DEFINITIONS

- **hiree**: The party being hired (aka: developer, programmer, freelancer, agency, contractor, etc.)
- **the company**: "The company" (also "company", "serp", "SERP", "our team", "us")


## DONE CRITERIA 

For any coding/programming work, **all boxes must be checked** to be considered complete & eligible for payment:

- [ ] Coded to SERP Standards: All new code meets all code conventions & code quality requirements, formatting & best practices.
- [ ] Code has been improved / refactored if possible, and technical debt is removed.
- [ ] Coded test-first, with "developer tests" written for all new & refactored code. This includes unit tests, integration tests, automated acceptance tests.
- [ ] Minimum code coverage of 90%, evidenced by a report generated from a github action/workflow.
- [ ] Code tested locally in an identical environment to `development` / `production`, with no failures
- [ ] Code has been properly committed according to conventions & workflow guidelines
- [ ] Automated CI code tests have run, with no failures, and generated a report that meets or exceeds all KPIs
- [ ] Integrated with no failures, bugs or regressions
- [ ] Delivered with evidence (reports) of all KPIs & metrics being met or exceeded
- [ ] Delivered with all necessary documentation completed
- [ ] Reviewed & approved
- [ ] Clean & housekeeping performed (remote branches deleted, project tasks closed, etc.)

### CORRECTIONS

If there are any bugs/issues/updates/corrections that need to be made, they will be made at programmers own time & expense. We do not pay for revisions, bug fixes, self-cleanup, or anything that brings the code to our above detailed "Definition of done".

If _our_ team needs to apply the fixes, we will track our team's time spent and bill it against any pending hours/invoices for work done by hiree.

Our rate for coding varies depending on the area of expertise, starting at $250/hr. for front-end web design and up.

## USER STORIES

The most common use of  DoD is on the delivery team level.  Done on this level means the Product Owner reviewed and accepted the user story. Once accepted, the “done” user story will  contribute to the team velocity.  You must meet all of the defined criteria or the user story isn’t done.

- Unit tests passed
- Code reviewed
- Acceptance criteria met
- Functional tests passed
- Non-Functional requirements met
- Product Owner accepts the User Story

## FEATURES

Done on this level may mean it qualifies to add to a release.  Not all user stories need to be completed. Rather, it means the feature may be sufficient to satisfy the need. Once accepted, the done feature will contribute to the release velocity.  Again, you must meet all of the defined criteria or the feature isn’t done.

### Feature DoD Examples:

- Acceptance criteria met
- Integrated into a clean build
- Promoted to higher level environment
- Automated regression tests pass
- Feature level functional tests passed
- Non-Functional requirements met
- Meets compliance requirements
- Functionality documented in necessary user user documentation
